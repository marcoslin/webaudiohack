Web Audio Hack
============

Following [Firefox OS Mobile Hack Tea](http://www.meetup.com/codeinvaders/events/153091982/),
here is the cleaned up version of JavaScript code that:

1. Loads an audio file
2. Create a volume percentage number
3. Display this volume in a progress bar on a webpage
4. Send this volume info to a server
5. Visualize the volume info on server

Implementation
============

The objective here is to use pure Javascript on a HTML5 browser without any 3rd party libraries.
The code is also kept as simple as possible, concentrating on delivering the objectives set above.

The audio is loaded using `<audio>` HTML5 tag and volume meter is based on a simple `<div>`.
Communication between web client and server is based on `Websocket`.  On
the server side [`node-multimeter`](https://github.com/substack/node-multimeter) is used to generate the volume meter on the console.

Usage
============

After cloning this project, do:

1. `npm install`
1. `node server.js`
1. Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) using latest version of Chrome or Firefox

Note
============

* `proxy.js` has been created to make this work in Firefox. See 
  [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20469190/createmediaelementsource-method-of-web-audio-api-in-firefox)
  on Stackoverflow for more detail.
* Firefox 25.0.1 has a bug that when an HTML5 audio is interecepted, the sound progress does not work.  It will stay at
  initial position and jump directly to the end when sound is over.
